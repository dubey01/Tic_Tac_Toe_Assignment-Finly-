Tic Tac Toe Assignment (Finly)

How To Run the code:-

1. Paste the code in https://replit.com/languages/java10
2. Hit Run
3. Enter input as:- 
   X Gaurav
   O Naman
   after this, it will print an empty grid.
   
   after that enter row and col as:-
   1 2
   it will print the grid after each row and col and after that you can again input other cells till the time all the 9 cells are filled
   
   once all the cells are filled it prints "Game Over"
   and prints "Invalid move" if you try to overwrite any cell
   
   Note: Due to time constraint, I wasn't able to complete the winner method logic.
   
   Assumptions: (System working)
   1. only two players are playing
   2. input coordinates can be (1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 2 3, 3 1, 3 2, 3 3), apart from any of these it may throw out of bounds error as it's not handled in the         code
   3. grid size is 3x3
   4. No check for the pieces (X, O), any char can be entered.

How To Run the code:-

1. Paste the code in https://replit.com/languages/java10
2. Hit Run
3. Enter input as:- 
   X Gaurav
   O Naman
   after this, it will print an empty grid.
   
   after that enter row and col as:-
   1 2
   it will print the grid after each row and col and after that you can again input other cells till the time all the 9 cells are filled
   
   once all the cells are filled it prints "Game Over"
   and prints "Invalid move" if you try to overwrite any cell
   
   Note: Due to time constraint, I wasn't able to complete the winner method logic.
